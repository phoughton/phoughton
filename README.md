## Hello & Welcome

If you made it here then you are probably, at least a bit, technical. That's Great! I'm a geek and when I'm not being paid to write, tinker with or test software, you'll probably still find me tinkering with some new (or old) tech.

I'm a consultant & incurable python hacker who started out as a Java developer back in the 1990s, and has done Software Development, Automation, Development in Test, Architecture in companies large and small. 

I have had the opportunity to work in fields from Media (_The Telegraph, BBC, Sky & Financial Times_), via Oil and Gas (_BP_) to Banking & International High Value Payments (_NatWest, BNP Paribas & Lloyds Banking Group_) as well as start ups.

Sadly most of my work is internal to my clients but here are a few of my more interesting bits of code from my side projects:
