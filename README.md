## Hello & Welcome

If you made it here then you are probably, at least a bit, technical. That's Great! I'm a geek and when I'm not being paid to write, tinker with or test software, you'll probably still find me tinkering with some new (or old) tech.

Here are a few of my more interesting bits of code:
